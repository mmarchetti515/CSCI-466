Entities
==========================
- Employees
	- Employees have the attributes of emp_id, which is the key identifier,
		job title, specialty, pay rate, and name. All of these are traits
		that describe an employee object and are necessary for the db. 
		All of the attributes are self descriptive of their function.
- Clients
	- Clients have the attributes of account_id, and email, which are the 
		key identifiers. They also have name, address, and phone number
		as suppplemental identifiers. These are all self descriptive of
		their function.	
- Services_offered
	- Services_offered have the attributes service_sku, which is the key 
		identifier, manicures, massages, waxes, makeup, hair, and price. These
		are all of the service packages offered. The price is unique for each
		individual service.
- Schedule
	- Schedule has the key identifier, emp_link, and the other attributes of
		date and time. emp_link is how the schedule is linked to an employee
		through their employee id.
Relationships
=========================
- orders
	- This has a 1,1 cardinality from clients, as in this situation, a client
		will only be making one order, and if there are multiple orders from 
		a single client, they will be handled under different appointment_id.
	- This has a 1, n cardinality to services_offered, since an order can contain 
		multiple services. 
	- This relationship also has the attributes, appointment_id, and 
		invoice_number, both of which are the key identifiers, and bill, and
		services_requested. These supplementary attributes are critical for
		this relationship.
	- This and the attributes linked allow the client to be automatically billed.
	- Appointment information allows the client to be reminded of their
		appointment date.
- performs
	- This has a 1,1 cardinality from employees, since only one employee will
		do the action of performing for a single appointment.
	- This has a 1,n cardinality to services_offered, since potentially many 
		services can be performed for one appointment. 
	- Employees can perform any service.
- requests
	- This has a 1,1 cardinality from clients, as a client will only be making a
		single request for a single appointment in this case.
	- This has a 1,1 cardinality to employees, as only one request will be for 
		one employee, assuming, in this case, that only one employee handles 
		one client, per appointment.
	- This allows a client to choose a preffered employee.
